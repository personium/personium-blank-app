## Preaparation for deployment

### Update configurations

#### Config: Building and Deployment

Rename from `config.example.js` to `config.js` and modify it as below.

```js
module.exports = {
  personium: {
    CELL_NAME: "<CELL_NAME>", // A name of Application Cell
    CELL_FQDN: "<CELL_FQDN>", // FQDN of Application Cell
    // ...
  },
};
```

- `<CELL_NAME>`, the application Cell's name ( like `app-template` )
- `<CELL_FQDN>` reveals application cell's FQDN ( like `app-template.demo.personium.io` )

#### Config: Application Cell

Rename from `src/assets/launch.example.json` to `src/assets/launch.json` and modify it as below.

```json
{
  "personal": {
    "web": "https://<CELL_FQDN>/__/front/app",
    "android": "***:",
    "ios": "***;"
  }
}
```

#### Config: Box in User Cell I

Rename from `src/bar/00_meta/00_manifest.example.json` to `src/bar/00_meta/00_manifest.json` and modify it as below.

```json
{
  "bar_version": "2",
  "box_version": "1",
  "default_path": "<DEFAULT_BOX_NAME>",
  "schema": "<CELL_URL>"
}
```

- `<DEFAULT_BOX_NAME>` reveals a name of Box created in User Cell when installation is done.
- `<CELL_URL>` reveals URL of App Cell ( scheme + `<CELL_FQDN>` + `/` ).

#### Config: Box in User Cell II

Rename from `src/bar/00_meta/90_rootprops.example.xml` to `src/bar/00_meta/90_rootprops.xml`. ( without modifing )

#### Config: Application Settings

Rename the file from `src/app/frontend/Constants/AppConstant.example.js` to `src/app/frontend/Constants/AppConstant.js` and modify its contents as below.

```js
export const AppConstant = {
  cellUrl: '<CELL_URL>',
  installBoxName: '<BOX_NAME>',
  barFileUrl: '<BAR_FILE_URL>',
};
```

- `<BOX_NAME>`, the default target Box name in user Cell. It is often set same as `<CELL_NAME>` typically.
- `<BAR_FILE_URL>` , the URL of the `bar` file to be built in next step. It is often placed somewhere public in App Cell.

### Build

#### Install Node.js dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Building `bar` file

Build `bar` file with below command.

```bash
npm run build-bar
```

`bar` file contains structure of Application Box created in User Cell with installation.

This command generates `dist/<CELL_NAME>.bar`. You can install with this file from Home App Menu.

#### Building App

Build App with below command.

```bash
npm run build
```

This command build application into `build` folder.

### Develop and Debug

The following command will start a localhost [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) server on port `8080` for application development.

```bash
npm run debug
```

### Deploy

#### Deploying built stuff

Upload built stuff ( Apps and static-files ) with below command.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command refers credentials in env value. Make sure below env value are set before try this code.

| ValueName        | Description                                     |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| `PERSONIUM_USER` | Username of admin user in your application cell |
| `PERSONIUM_PASS` | Password of admin user in your application cell |

You can run this command with setting env value like below command.

In Linux,

```bash
PERSONIUM_USER=*** PERSONIUM_PASS=*** npm run deploy
```

In Windows,

```cmd
set PERSONIUM_USER=*** && set PERSONIUM_PASS=*** && npm run deploy
```

#### Configure ACL

Configurign ACL is conducted manually in the [Unit Manager](https://github.com/personium/app-uc-unit-manager) administration page.

1. Set `exec` to `all(anyone)` in `front` service.
1. Set `read` to `all(anyone)` in `public` folder.
1. Set `read` to `all(anyone)` in `locales` folder.

#### Make application specs public

Set `read` to `all(anyone)` to below (4 files).

- launch.json
- profile.json
- relations.json
- roles.json

## Execute

In Home App of user who installs `bar` file above can launch this application by touching icon.

![Home](docs/launch_app/001.png)

![Launch App](docs/launch_app/002.png)

The entrypoint of this application is `src/app/frontend/index.js`.

```es6
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello React!</h1>, document.getElementById("root"));
```

So, you can implement SPA application with React.js by modifing this codes.
